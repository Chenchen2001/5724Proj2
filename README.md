# 5724Proj2
Source Code && Report for CMSC 5724 Project 2 Margin Perceptron.

In this Project, we have implemented the margin perceptron algorithm to construct a margin perceptron to get the classified label based on features.

The program can be executed by using the command:

```shell
 .\run.bat
```

in the root direction of the project folder in Windows or just double click the file run.bat, or using the command:

```shell
./run.sh
```

in the root direction of the project folder in Linux or MacOS. 

The output of the program will be kept in the file `res.txt` for storage.
